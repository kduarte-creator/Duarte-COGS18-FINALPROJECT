    "As a first time coder keeping up with this class was really daunting. After dedicating a bunch of time learning new concepts, a lot of practice, and long days in front of a computer, I have been able to learn a lot. Although it was very difficult, I am glad I took this course that made me push pass the boundaries of what I am comfortable doing. With that said, although it is not much, this project took me several hours to plan and execute, along with lots of vists to office hours to work out all the bugs, and I have put a lot of effort towards making this a cohesive working colletcion of code.
